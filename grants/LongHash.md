# LongHash Global Incubator

## Project Description
Founded in February 2018, LongHash is a global incubator. Currently we have 6 offices covering Asia and Europe, inculding Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Berlin and Zug. LongHash’s mission is to accelerate the development and understanding of blockchain technology. 


### Incubation As A Service
Our 12-week structured accelerator programs is run in our Singapore office and is supported by the government to run a few batches a year to incubate 5-10 projects. Our structured incubation program provides a full range of support for early-stage blockchain projects. This includes, but is not limited to, mentoring, investor outreach, PR/marketing/community management, technical delivery, and modularized knowledge sharing. 
 
LongHash believes that Incubation as a Service (IaaS) can boost adoption through well executed incubation programs with clear milestones andduration, without the complexity of setting up an incubator. In specific, we drive adoption and awareness of the protocol and token. We boost quality and raise funds for dApps within the community, shorten and simplify the process to set up the own incubator for protocols.
 
With our rich experience in building DEX, hardware wallet, rating platform, custodian services and data analysis platform, LongHash is uniquely positioned to provide a comprehensive and solid IaaS solution for protocols.
 
LongHash is very impressed with the usability and flexibility of Polkadot/ Substrate, and believe we can partner up to attract startups to utilize blockchain technology through Polkadot/ Substrate. We aim to provide long-term IaaS for Polkadot/ Substrate through our structured incubation program and to boost the adoption for Polkadot/ Substrate. 

### Marketing & Community Building
LongHash has a professional team regarding Marketing and Community Building. Our offices in Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and Berlin have strong local resources and are fully experienced in hosting meetups, workshops, conferences and hackathons. 

LongHash Singapore office invited representatives from Web3 Foundation for a speaking opportunity on “No Block is an Island - Joining Chains in Enterprises” during our first DLT Compass conference organized by LongHash on 7th-8th June. There were over 300 attendees from a variety of industries with unprecedented concentration from enterprises, embracing a practical yet optimistic stance on blockchain technology. There were also a significant number of attendees from different technology providers, such as Huawei, IBM and Singtel. We also had attendees from the different Government bodies (Monetary Authority of Singapore, Enterprise Singapore, IMDA which oversees technology and Innovation in Singapore) as well as educators from a number of institutions (INSEAD, National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technology University, SUSS, ESSEC business school).

LongHash Shanghai Team just co-hosted a Meet-Up together with Web3 and its ecosystem partners in Shanghai on 12th June. There were more than 200 attendants, 7000 online participants joined the Shanghai Meet-Up, with more than 50,000 media exposure during the 2-week-preparation. 

In the future, LongHash is very confident that we could continue as Web3 and its ecosystem’s great marketing and community partner, by providing professional and high-end marketing and PR services, so as to help Web3 and its ecosystem projects to build the community all over the world. We would use the grant to help projects with fundraising.

### LongHash Corporate Innovation Program 
LongHash firmly believes that blockchain adoption for traditional corporates would be a undoubtable trend in the coming few years, therefore the Corporate Innovation Program is designed to involve more traditional corporates into the blockchain industry, by helping them to equip with a general knowledge of the technology and to apply blockchain in the real daily work. We are now in talks with multiple multinational corporations for corporate membership where LongHash is providing access to relevant startups, exclusive invites to relevant events, and customized research. LongHash can refer Web3 Foundation and Polkadot as key thought leaders working on leading edge technology in the blockchain space. LongHash and Web3 could also co-host training workshops and design educational courses for corporates in the future. 

### Staking As A Service
LongHash, together with our Staking Partner, HashQuark, are planning to provide Staking As A Service for world famous public chains. HashQuark, member of HashKey Group, is a service provider focusing on public chains built upon the likes of PoS and DPoS. With HashQuark, token holders simply need to store tokens into their accounts and receive staking rewards in return. HashQuark Open Staking Platform, part of HashQuark, has entered into cooperation with the world’s leading crypto wallets and exchanges, offering staking services to tokens holders and institutional investors in a secure and stable way. We would like to start from being Polkadot’s validator.
